# Chinese-Economy-over-COVID-19
I used data from the Chinese government website, Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, and Wind terminals to complete this study. The Chinese government website provided Chinese quarterly GDP and per capita consumption from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q3. The Chinese National Bureau of Statistics provided quarterly final consumption, gross capital formation, and net exports as percentage components of GDP from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q3. The Wind terminals provided quarterly operating incomes and daily stock prices from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q3 for the Chinese pharmaceutical, leisure, and retail sectors. The stock prices were converted to a quarterly basis by taking the average of the closing prices for the quarter. I ran three groups of correlations: correlations between industry operating incomes and GDP, between operating incomes and per capita consumption, and between operating incomes and industry stock prices. All data were converted to quarter-on-quarter percentage changes when running correlations, as I would like to track the short-term fluctuations in the economy. The data can be used to study the impact of COVID-19 on Chinese Economy in 2020.
